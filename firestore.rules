/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Post Weaver Application
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for designs,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify their own design data.
 * Design templates are publicly readable but not writable.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, with 'userId' matching the Firebase auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/designs/{designId}: Stores design data, with 'userId' mirroring the parent user's ID.
 * - /design-templates/{templateId}: Stores publicly readable design templates.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Users can only read and write their own data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Designs are owned by the user under /users/{userId}/designs/{designId}
 * - Listing of design templates is public.
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - The 'Design' entity includes a 'userId' field to simplify ownership checks and avoid costly `get()` calls.
 *   This denormalization allows for direct comparison with `request.auth.uid` in the rules.
 *
 * @structural_segregation
 * - Design templates are stored in a separate, top-level collection (/design-templates) to allow public read access
 *   without exposing user-specific data.
